    <h1>Dead!</h1>
    <h2>by Brian Roys</h2>

        I was folding laundry when, <i>ding</i>, the whole idea for a story came to mind.
        The characters, the plot, the problem, the twists, and the resolution complete.
        I ran to my computer and pounded it out (I can type fast) in a couple hours (5,000 words).
        My wife is a wordsmith so I sent it to her for editing. She sent it back with a few 
        changes and I made them.
        I was happy with it and sent it to a few friends. They liked it too.
        So I published it on Amazon Direct Publishing. The only thing lingering was
        to follup with a sequel. I had a few ideas but nothing solid.

        That was 2008 I think. Couple years later and I get a check from Amazon for $1.35.
        I had sold three copies! I still have the check.

        Its a good story, worth the $0.99 I charged for it. And I've since sold a few more copies.

        The title is <i>Dead</i>, then years later it dawned on me that the sequel should be 
        <i>Reincarnated</i>. &mdash;
        Act 1, Scene 1; 13 year old Julie Farerri is reminded that she was Blake Ryan
        (the main character in <i>Dead</i>) in a past life!
